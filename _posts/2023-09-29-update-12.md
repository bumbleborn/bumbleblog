Hello again, it's been a while.

Almost 5 months since I last posted anything, a lot has happened in that time so let's start things off simple.

### What is this again?

This is a blog / journal / thing for the thoughts and works of me,<br>
bumbleborn, aka joe, aka... actually that's it, it's just those 2.

### But wa... it's different

Yes, I was using substack before and whilst it had a whole bunch of fancy features it ultimately felt like overkill for what I wanted, I also feel some distance from what _social platforms_ have become tbh.

Substack, twitter (I refuse to say it), facebook, tumblr, myspace, etc.

They all seem to be terrible in one way or another, either they're ruled by somewhat awful people or they're commanded by a group of shareholders that have no real stake in the game, they just want money.

So, I've spent the last 2 weeks learning html, css, jekyll, ruby, etc and I'll be honest... web dev sucks. I get why people don't make their own websites, I have no idea how to get this web site to look good on phones something to do with user agents or media queries but it's just technical babble really, the main thing is that I have this space now, I can make it whatever I want it to be, I'm sure I'll expand and add to it over time but for now it'll be super simple.

To make sure it could do everything I needed I've ported all my old substack posts into it and whilst I don't think I'm gonna go back to weekly updates but I'll try for some consistency.

### Future Plans

Okay, so I have this shiny new site and it's been 5 months

I'll do a post on it at some point but Unity, the game engine I spend most of my professional time, recently made a massive mistake with how it was monetising it's platform in the near future. It was a really hectic 2 weeks as almost everyone I knew that worked in had a mini-meltdown (_myself included_).

Basically, because of this I started looking into other engines, I feel incredibly lucky that spent the last 4 months making a mini playdate game
