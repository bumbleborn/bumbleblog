It’s a cold January morning and it’ll be 56 days until the sun stays skybound till 6pm, but for the first time in months it’s shining outside. The air is filled with fresh “New Year, New Me” sentiments, new years resolutions tend to expire by February but this year, I’m following the storage instructions and keeping mine in the fridge.

## What is this and why should I care?

Hiya, I’m Joe (Bumbleborn on socials), a technical designer at Radical Forge, a games studio in the North East of England. I also work on my own games on the side, and after 5 - 6 years of working in games (design / art / etc.) I feel like I have moved past just dabbling, so I’d like to be a bit more serious with my goals.

I’m gonna keep these posts simple;

  * First, an article about something.
  * Then, what happened the previous week.
  * Finally, my aims for the week following.

I’ll be talking about an array of topics that interest me... and hopefully you.

As a primer I wanna quickly talk about a few projects I’ve been spending a lot of time on the last few months / years and what my plans are with them.

## Echo’s Climb

I’m gonna be changing the name soon cause my god, everyone hears “Echoes Climb” when I say it out loud. Bad title aside, what is it?

Echo’s Climb is a 3D platformer with a souls-like interconnected world, there’s no combat though. Instead of bosses there are giant complicated jumping challenges that require a similar amount of patience, it’s simple gameplay that feels good to master.

Set in a subterranean realm where everything sentient has been turned to stone, players ascend through the three kingdoms, discovering their past and hopefully saving their future.

It’s a big game to make for 1 person and will likely take me into 2024 to finish… maybe longer, but it’s honestly a dream game to work on. I’ll talk about why in a future update, for now onto the next game.

## Wunderwurld

“Viva Pinata but in the UNDERWORLD!”, that’s literally all there is to it. I’m making it with my partner Emily and it’s the first project we’ve started together that we’ve stayed excited about, we’re both doing bits of all of it but it mostly breaks down to me on code and her on art, then we both co-design.

I’m happy to show it early but this will likely be in the tank for a while, I’m building the core game loop with simple 3d stuff and 2D character mockups first, whilst Emily works on the 3D characters, exploring style & pipeline.

Here’s a concept video of the demo in it’s current state.

I’ve been down a bit of a rabbit hole regarding procedural generation lately. In particular, I’ve been studying techniques on lock and key dungeon generation, as it’s often called, though “dungeon” is a bit of a misnomer since most of these techniques can just as easily apply to other use cases. At its core, the lock and key model is about specifying paths of progression alongside the constraints to that progression. So while you absolutely can use it to generate a Zelda-like dungeon where you need to obtain keys or abilities to unlock new areas, you could also use it to model investigative games, where uncovering clues allows for new dialogue options that can affect the outcome of your mission, or use it to design an entire game world where each area, once completed, provides an item or triggers an event that lets you progress to the next one.
