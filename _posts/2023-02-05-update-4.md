Good mumble once again,

I managed to get some rough SFX and music into the game! It’s been a really positive experience and a massive morale boost on the project, it’s absurd how much more “real” a game feels with sound effects.

This week I’m gonna go into detail about how I’ve set up the audio in Wunderwurld. It’s not too fancy but it does get the job done, when we start production I will implement an proper sound effects engine like FMOD or WWise but for now…

### What do I want to control when I play a sound effect?

What do I want to be in charge of and what do I want the game to take care of automatically?

For example, when I play a “Dig Dirt” sound I want it to choose between 3 different sounds at random, not choose the same sound consecutively and I ideally want this behaviour to be generic so it can apply to many SFX.

To solve this I created a SFX Data Scriptable Object (Scriptable Objects are just files that hold data), it can hold multiple sound files and you can set it to never repeat.

My SFX manager class makes it easy to feed these files in from across the project to play SFX with one line of code.

{% highlight js %}

SFXManager.Instance.PlayOneShot(sfxDig, worldPos);

{% endhighlight %}

I have a separate system for handling SFX loops like pouring water from a watering can, then another to handle the ambient river loop, increasing and decreasing the volume of it based on the players distance to the water.

Finally the music manager tries to keep the music fresh by swapping between 2 types of music section, choosing a random loop each time. One from group A plays, then one from group B, then back to A. I’m gonna extend this with some more sections later with a calmer loop thrown in to break it up.

You can hear the slight differences between the loops below.
