Hello there,<br>

I'm bumbleborn and I make <span class="highlighted-text">_video games_</span>

I've been working in games for over 6 years, I'm currently a senior tech designer at a very cool game studio and I make small independent games on the side.

I have a deep love for interesting games that play with established mechanics.
